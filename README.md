2. Generate GCODE files for your specific printer with at least 50% infill. No supports required.
3. Print out the 3D boxes

## Instructions For Flight
1. Before using the delivery box, you need to disable the bottom sensors of the DJI Mavic or DJI Phantom from within your DJI Go 4 app's settings.
2. Secure and center the drone delivery device directly underneath the drone.
